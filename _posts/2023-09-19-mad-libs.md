## Introduction to Mad Libs

Mad Libs is a fun word game that involves filling in the blank spaces in a provided story with different types of words (such as nouns, adjectives, names, numbers, etc.).

**Take this story, for example.**
```
Pizza was invented by a creative Italian chef named Luigi. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of dough, and make a thin, round crust. Then you cover it with savory sauce, melted cheese, and fresh chopped vegetables. Next, you have to bake it in a very hot oven. When it is done, cut it into eight slices. Some people like pepperoni pizza the best, but my favorite is the margherita pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza 3 times a day!
```

**This template can be created from the above story.**
```
Pizza was invented by a {adjective} {nationality} chef named {name}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective} {noun}. Then you cover it with {adjective} sauce, {adjective} cheese, and fresh chopped {plural noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun}. When it is done, cut it into {number} {shapes}. Some people like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {number} times a day!
```

**By substituting the blank spaces with random words, you can create a playful variation of the original story.**
```
Pizza was invented by a mischievous Martian chef named Zog. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of moon rock, and make a thin, round radioactive pizza. Then you cover it with slimy sauce, gooey cheese, and fresh chopped tentacles. Next, you have to bake it in a very hot volcano. When it is done, cut it into 12 trapezoids. Some people like asteroid pizza the best, but my favorite is the wormhole pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza 42 times a day!
```

## Building a Mad Libs Generator in Python

### Step 1: Define the Mad Lib Template
We can define the template using a variable called `template` that contains a **string** with placeholders. Curly braces `{}` are employed as placeholders in a Python string to dynamically insert values into the string using the `format()` method. Text enclosed within the curly braces represents the names of the placeholders and adheres to the same rules as variable names.

```{{ page.language }}
template = "Pizza was invented by a {adjective} {nationality} chef named {name}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective} {noun}. Then you cover it with {adjective} sauce, {adjective} cheese, and fresh chopped {plural noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun}. When it is done, cut it into {number} {shapes}. Some people like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {number} times a day!"
```

We can use empty curly braces to specify where to insert values in the `template` string and define a **list** of strings called `words` that contains descriptions for each placeholder in the template string.

```{{ page.language }}
template = "Pizza was invented by a {} {} chef named {}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {}, and make a thin, round {} {}. Then you cover it with {} sauce, {} cheese, and fresh chopped {}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {}. When it is done, cut it into {} {}. Some people like {} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {} times a day!"

words = [
    "adjective", "nationality", "name", "noun", "adjective", "noun", "adjective",
    "adjective", "plural noun", "noun", "number", "shapes", "food", "food", "number"
]
```

### Step 2: Input Words from the User
In the code below, we employ the concept of **iteration**, which involves repeating steps or instructions multiple times, often referred to as a **loop**. Python offers various types of loops, and in this case, we use a `for loop`. Here, `i` serves as a counter that iterates through the elements using the `range` function. The `len` function returns the length of a given list. The first element of the list is accessed as `words[0]`, the second element as `words[1]`, and so on. This is known as **indexing**. Each word type from the list is replaced with a candidate word using the `input` function, which collects text input from the user.

[Learn more about the input function in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)

[Learn more about the range function in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp)

[Learn more about the len function in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
for i in range(len(words)):
    words[i] = input(f"Enter a/an {words[i]}: ")
```

To determine the appropriate article (a/an) to be used for the descriptor, we use a **conditional** structure, commonly known as an `if-else block`. `words[i][0]` signifies the first character in the string `words[i]`. In this particular case, the `in` keyword is used to check if a value is present in the list, specifically if the first character in `words[i]` is one of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u). In this instance, we can simplify the `if-else block` using **ternary operators**, which follow the syntax `(value if true) if (condition) else (value if false)` and cannot be applied in every case.

[Learn more about the in keyword in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
for i in range(len(words)):
    article = "an" if words[i][0] in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] else "a"
    words[i] = input(f"Enter {article} {words[i]}: ")
```

### Step 3: Fill in the Template
We can utilize the `format()` function in Python to populate our Mad Libs template with the words from the `words` list. The `format()` function inserts the specified value(s) into the curly braces within the string.

[Learn more about string formatting in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
mad_lib = template.format(*words)
```

The `format()` function takes a comma separated sequence of values, providing it with a list would result in an error. Therefore, we need to use a **destructuring operator** to pass a comma-separated sequence formed from the elements in the `words` list to the `format()` function. Destructuring operators in Python are illustrated in the code block below.

```{{ page.language }}
>>> test = ["element1", "element2", "element3"]

# print(["element1", "element2", "element3"])
>>> print(test)
['element1', 'element2', 'element3']

# print("element1", "element2", "element3")
>>> print(test)
element1 element2 element3
```

### Step 4: Display the Generated Mad Lib
The `print()` function in Python is used to display text on the screen. By default, all print statements end with a newline character (`\n`). To enhance the readability of the outputted text, we can add newline characters to the string being printed and use empty `print()` functions (which create a newline).

```{{ page.language }}
print("\nYour Mad Lib Story:\n")
print(mad_lib)
print()
```

### Putting It All Together
Lines that begin with a `#` character in Python are referred to as **comments**. When used appropriately, comments enhance code readability and offer explanations for human developers. It's important to note that comments are never executed by the computer; they solely serve as documentation for the code.

# Define the template
template = "Pizza was invented by a {} {} chef named {}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {}, and make a thin, round {} {}. Then you cover it with {} sauce, {} cheese, and fresh chopped {}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {}. When it is done, cut it into {} {}. Some people like {} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {} times a day!"

# Input words from the user

    "adjective", "plural noun", "noun", "number", "shapes", "food", "food", "number"
]

for i in range(len(words)):
    article = "an" if words[i][0] in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] else "a"
    words[i] = input(f"Enter {article} {words[i]}: ")

# Fill in the template
mad_lib = template.format(*words)

# Print the generated Mad Lib
