## Introduction to Mad Libs

In this tutorial, we will create a Mad Libs generator using Python. Mad Libs is a fun word game that involves filling in the blank spaces in a provided story with different types of words (such as nouns, adjectives, names, numbers, etc.).

**Take this story, for example.**
```
Pizza was invented by a creative Italian chef named Luigi. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of dough, and make a thin, round crust. Then you cover it with savory sauce, melted cheese, and fresh chopped vegetables. Next, you have to bake it in a very hot oven. When it is done, cut it into eight slices. Some people like pepperoni pizza the best, but my favorite is the margherita pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza 3 times a day!
```

**This template can be created from the above story.**
```
Pizza was invented by a {adjective} {nationality} chef named {name}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective} {noun}. Then you cover it with {adjective} sauce, {adjective} cheese, and fresh chopped {plural noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun}. When it is done, cut it into {number} {shapes}. Some people like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {number} times a day!
```

**By substituting the blank spaces with random words, you can create a playful variation of the original story.**
```
Pizza was invented by a mischievous Martian chef named Zog. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of moon rock, and make a thin, round radioactive pizza. Then you cover it with slimy sauce, gooey cheese, and fresh chopped tentacles. Next, you have to bake it in a very hot volcano. When it is done, cut it into 12 trapezoids. Some people like asteroid pizza the best, but my favorite is the wormhole pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza 42 times a day!
```

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, please ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If you haven't already installed Python, you can download and install it from the official Python website [here](https://www.python.org/).

## Running Python on your Computer

In order to run the app, save your python code in a file with the extension `.py`, and execute the script with the following command.
```
python3 <path_to_file>
```

## Building a Mad Libs Generator in Python

### Step 1: Define the Mad Lib Template
We can define the template using a variable called `template` that contains a **string** with placeholders. Curly braces `{}` are employed as placeholders in a Python string to dynamically insert values into the string using the `format()` method. Text enclosed within the curly braces represents the names of the placeholders and adheres to the same rules as variable names.

```{{ page.language }}
template = "Pizza was invented by a {adjective} {nationality} chef named {name}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective} {noun}. Then you cover it with {adjective} sauce, {adjective} cheese, and fresh chopped {plural noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun}. When it is done, cut it into {number} {shapes}. Some people like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {number} times a day!"
```

We can use empty curly braces to specify where to insert values in the `template` string and define a **list** of strings called `words` that contains descriptions for each placeholder in the template string.

[Learn more about lists in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
template = "Pizza was invented by a {} {} chef named {}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {}, and make a thin, round {} {}. Then you cover it with {} sauce, {} cheese, and fresh chopped {}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {}. When it is done, cut it into {} {}. Some people like {} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {} times a day!"

words = [
    "adjective", "nationality", "name", "noun", "adjective", "noun", "adjective",
    "adjective", "plural noun", "noun", "number", "shapes", "food", "food", "number"
]
```

### Step 2: Input Words from the User
In the code below, we employ the concept of **iteration**, which involves repeating steps or instructions multiple times, often referred to as a **loop**. Python offers various types of loops, and in this case, we use a `for loop`. Here, `i` serves as a counter that iterates through the elements using the `range` function. The `len` function returns the length of a given list. The first element of the list is accessed as `words[0]`, the second element as `words[1]`, and so on. This is known as **indexing**. Each word type from the list is replaced with a candidate word using the `input` function, which collects text input from the user.

[Learn more about the input function in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)

[Learn more about the range function in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp)

[Learn more about the len function in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
for i in range(len(words)):
    words[i] = input(f"Enter a/an {words[i]}: ")
```

To determine the appropriate article (a/an) to be used for the descriptor, we use a **conditional** structure, commonly known as an `if-else block`. `words[i][0]` signifies the first character in the string `words[i]`. In this particular case, the `in` keyword is used to check if a value is present in the list, specifically if the first character in `words[i]` is one of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u). In this instance, we can simplify the `if-else block` using **ternary operators**, which follow the syntax `(value if true) if (condition) else (value if false)` and cannot be applied in every case.

[Learn more about the in keyword in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
for i in range(len(words)):
    article = "an" if words[i][0] in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] else "a"
    words[i] = input(f"Enter {article} {words[i]}: ")
```

### Step 3: Fill in the Template
We can utilize the `format()` function in Python to populate our Mad Libs template with the words from the `words` list. The `format()` function inserts the specified value(s) into the curly braces within the string.

[Learn more about string formatting in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp)

```{{ page.language }}
mad_lib = template.format(*words)
```

The `format()` function takes a comma separated sequence of values, providing it with a list would result in an error. Therefore, we need to use a **destructuring operator** to pass a comma-separated sequence formed from the elements in the `words` list to the `format()` function. Destructuring operators in Python are illustrated in the code block below.

```{{ page.language }}
>>> test = ["element1", "element2", "element3"]

# print(["element1", "element2", "element3"])
>>> print(test)
['element1', 'element2', 'element3']

# print("element1", "element2", "element3")
>>> print(test)
element1 element2 element3
```

### Step 4: Display the Generated Mad Lib
The `print()` function in Python is used to display text on the screen. By default, all print statements end with a newline character (`\n`). To enhance the readability of the outputted text, we can add newline characters to the string being printed and use empty `print()` functions (which create a newline).

```{{ page.language }}
print("\nYour Mad Lib Story:\n")
print(mad_lib)
print()
```

### Putting It All Together
Lines that begin with a `#` character in Python are referred to as **comments**. When used appropriately, comments enhance code readability and offer explanations for human developers. It's important to note that comments are never executed by the computer; they solely serve as documentation for the code.

```{{ page.language }}
# Define the template
template = "Pizza was invented by a {} {} chef named {}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {}, and make a thin, round {} {}. Then you cover it with {} sauce, {} cheese, and fresh chopped {}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {}. When it is done, cut it into {} {}. Some people like {} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {} times a day!"

# Input words from the user
words = [
    "adjective", "nationality", "name", "noun", "adjective", "noun", "adjective",
    "adjective", "plural noun", "noun", "number", "shapes", "food", "food", "number"
]

for i in range(len(words)):
    article = "an" if words[i][0] in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] else "a"
    words[i] = input(f"Enter {article} {words[i]}: ")

# Fill in the template
mad_lib = template.format(*words)

# Print the generated Mad Lib
print("\nYour Mad Lib Story:\n")
print(mad_lib)
print()
```

Congratulations! You've created a Mad Libs generator application and you've taken your first step in your journey to learn Python.
